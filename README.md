# Tech Test â€“ PHP + JavaScript

## Task
You are given a dataset of travellers (`data/travellers.json`).

1. **Load & Display**  
   Use PHP to load the JSON and render the data into an HTML table.

2. **Filtering**  
   Implement dropdown filters (by country, by trip type).

3. **Sorting**  
   Make the table sortable by clicking on column headers.

4. **Styling**  
   Apply some CSS to make the table look clean and readable.

---

## Bonus (harder â€“ optional)
- Add a **search box** that live-filters by name.  
- Add an **average age per country** chart (e.g. simple bar chart with plain JS or `<canvas>`).  
- Highlight the **youngest traveller** in yellow automatically.  

---

## Rules
- You may use **plain PHP + JS** (no frameworks).  
- Do not install libraries (keep it simple).  
- You have ~1â€“2 hours.  

Good luck ðŸš€
